# Components

The component folder is the location of all of the components used on the website. We keep the components in its own package so that your component library can live byitself and be packaged up and used in websites. Each component has a standard folder stucture that continas all of the required files for development

> `packages/components/.storybook`

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation. We use it to organize and document the component library while doing front end component styling.

> `packages/components/cypress`

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser. We use it to run both end to end tests and individual component tests.

> `packages/components/src/@types`

Since the components use Typescript we need to declare any new types that will be part of the main theme. [Learn More](https://mui.com/customization/palette/#adding-new-colors)

> `packages/components/src/components`

This is the main folder that contains all of the components for the website. See below for more information about each of the component files.
Most of the components in this folder are themed versions of the LRCL components and will not include the component code but a reference to the original component.

We've included an example for how to do a custom component as well [see here]('./components/Quote.tsx').

```bash
├── ComponentName
│   ├── ComponentName.fragment.graphql # GraphQL fragment for defining data requirements
│   ├── ComponentName.mock.tsx # Mock data used for Storybook and automated tests
│   ├── ComponentName.spec.tsx # Cypress file for automatetd tests
│   ├── ComponentName.stories.tsx # Storybook file for the component stories
│   ├── ComponentName.test.tsx # Unit tests ran by React Testing Library
│   ├── ComponentName.theme.tsx # Styles, theme and variants
│   ├── ComponentName.tsx # React component business logic and structure
│   ├── index.tsx # Lookup for easy importing
```

> `packages/components/src/docs`

We use Storybook to add any documentation we want in Storybook. [Learn More](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction)

> `packages/components/src/theme`

We use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and [Themes](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) for styling all components. This allows you to create very different styles for a component using the same business logic. The theme specifies the color of the components, darkness of the surfaces, level of shadow, appropriate opacity of ink elements, etc. Themes let you apply a consistent tone to your app. It allows you to customize all design aspects of your project in order to meet the specific needs of your business or brand.

### Creating a new style variant

> `packages/components/src/utils`

A group of helper functions that are shared across all components.

> `packages/components/src/contentMapping.js`

This is the main file that is used to map content models and the variations to their components.

## Use Cases

### Updating the global theme and styles

Global styles are located in the `packages/components/src/theme/index.ts` file.

### Create new component variation

1. Go into the CMS and add a new variant option for the content model.
2. Open up the `ComponentName.theme.tsx`
3. Add a new variant object inside the variants array

```javascript
  //[
    //...,
    {
      props: {
        variant: 'example'
      },
      style: {
        backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.main
      }
    },
  //]
```

### Creating a new content model component

You first need to create a content model in Contentful or add a new variation option (if available).

1. Create a new folder in the components folder example: `packages/components/src/components/ComponentName` based off the component file structure above.
2. Add the import to `packages/components/src/contentMapping.js`
3. Add the component to the lookup. The key is the camelcase name of the content model

Example:

```javascript
// Other imports
const NewComponent = dynamic(() => import('@myapp/components/src/components/NewComponent'));

const contentMapping: {
  [key: string]: any
} = {
  // Other mappings
  NewComponent: NewComponent
};
```

### Adding a new component for a variation

If the variant will require a whole new component because you can't simply use styles, you can add it to the lookup this way:  
Example:

```javascript
// Other imports
const NewComponentVariation = dynamic(() => import('@myapp/components/src/components/NewComponentVariation'));

const contentMapping: {
  [key: string]: any
} = {
  // Other mappings
  'NewComponent:variation': NewComponentVariation
};
```
