Summary:
This code snippet is a configuration file for Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. It sets up the testing environment for a TypeScript project by defining the roots, transformation rules, module file extensions, and module path ignore patterns. Additionally, it specifies the preset to be used for running the tests.

Import statements:
The code does not contain any import statements as it is a configuration file and does not require external dependencies.

Script Summary:
The script serves as the configuration for Jest, providing the necessary settings for running tests in a TypeScript project. It defines the roots, transformation rules, module file extensions, module path ignore patterns, and the preset to be used.

Internal Functions:
The code does not contain any internal functions as it is a configuration file.

External Functions:
The code does not contain any external functions as it is a configuration file.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the Jest testing framework to set up the environment for running tests in a TypeScript project. It ensures that the testing environment is properly configured to handle TypeScript files and defines the behavior of the testing framework.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add custom Jest configuration options to this file?
2. What are the implications of modifying the module path ignore patterns?
3. How does the preset "ts-jest" affect the behavior of Jest during testing?
4. Can I define custom transformation rules for specific file types?
5. What are the consequences of adding additional module file extensions to the configuration?
