Summary:
This file contains GraphQL type definitions and mappers for the Query type, specifically for handling redirects and rewrites. It also exports the SITE_ID constant and imports necessary dependencies for processing redirects and rewrites.

Import statements:
- gql from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function for creating GraphQL query strings.
- ApolloContext from '@last-rev/types': Imports the ApolloContext type for handling Apollo Server context.
- getLocalizedField from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports the getLocalizedField function for retrieving localized fields from contentful entries.
- processRedirects from './utils/processRedirects': Imports the processRedirects function for processing redirects.
- processRewrites from './utils/processRewrites': Imports the processRewrites function for processing rewrites.

typeDef List:
- redirects(preview: Boolean!): [SiteRedirect]
- rewrites(preview: Boolean!): [SiteRedirect]

Mappers:
- Query: 
  - redirects: Handles retrieving and processing redirects based on the provided preview flag.
  - rewrites: Handles retrieving and processing rewrites based on the provided preview flag.

External Functions:
1. redirects: 
   - Parameters: preview (boolean), ctx (ApolloContext)
   - Returns: Array of processed redirects
   - Description: Retrieves the site entry, retrieves localized redirects, processes the redirects, and returns the processed redirects.

2. rewrites: 
   - Parameters: preview (boolean), ctx (ApolloContext)
   - Returns: Array of processed rewrites
   - Description: Retrieves the site entry, retrieves localized rewrites, processes the rewrites, and returns the processed rewrites.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by providing GraphQL type definitions and resolvers for handling redirects and rewrites. It relies on the ApolloContext for data loading and uses the getLocalizedField function to retrieve localized fields from contentful entries. Additionally, it interacts with the processRedirects and processRewrites functions to handle the processing of redirects and rewrites.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the redirects and rewrites queried in the GraphQL schema?
2. What is the structure of the SiteRedirect type and how are its fields defined?
3. How are the processRedirects and processRewrites functions implemented and what transformations do they apply to the data?
4. How is the SITE_ID determined and how does it affect the retrieval of site-specific data?
5. How are the preview flags used in the redirects and rewrites resolvers and how do they impact the data retrieval process?
