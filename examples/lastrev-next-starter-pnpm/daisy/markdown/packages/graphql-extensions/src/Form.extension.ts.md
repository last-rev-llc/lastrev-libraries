Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the ElementForm type with custom fields and defining resolvers for specific fields. It relies on utility functions to handle the resolution of these fields, providing a way to customize the behavior of the GraphQL schema.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add additional custom fields to the ElementForm type?
2. What are the available utility functions for resolving specific fields, and how do I use them?
3. How can I debug issues related to the resolution of custom fields in the ElementForm type?
4. Can you provide an example of a query that utilizes the extended ElementForm type with custom fields and resolvers?
