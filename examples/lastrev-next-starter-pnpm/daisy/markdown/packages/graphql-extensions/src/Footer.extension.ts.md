Summary:
This file is an extension for the GraphQL schema, specifically extending the type "Footer" with additional fields and custom resolver behavior. It defines the type definitions (typeDefs) for the extended Footer type and provides mappers to handle custom resolver logic for the fields.

Import statements:
- gql from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function from the 'graphql-tag' package for defining GraphQL schema.
- getLocalizedField from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports the getLocalizedField function from the '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core' package for handling localized fields in the Contentful CMS.
- ApolloContext from '@last-rev/types': Imports the ApolloContext type from the '@last-rev/types' package for defining the context object used in Apollo Server.
- defaultResolver from './utils/defaultResolver': Imports the defaultResolver function from the './utils/defaultResolver' file for handling default resolver behavior.

typeDef List:
- Footer: Extends the existing Footer type with additional fields such as introContents, logo, logoUrl, navigationItems, socialLinks, disclaimerText, copyrightDisclaimer, legalLinks, and hasSocialLinks.

Mappers:
- Footer: Defines custom resolver logic for the hasSocialLinks field and uses the defaultResolver for the backgroundColor field.

External Functions:
- hasSocialLinks: Custom resolver function for the hasSocialLinks field of the Footer type. It takes the footer object, args, and ctx (ApolloContext) as parameters and returns a boolean indicating whether socialLinks exist for the footer.
- backgroundColor: Uses the defaultResolver function to handle the resolver logic for the backgroundColor field of the Footer type.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the GraphQL schema with custom fields and resolver logic for the Footer type. It relies on the getLocalizedField function from the '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core' package to handle localized fields and uses the ApolloContext type for the context object in resolver functions.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add additional fields to the GraphQL schema for other types besides Footer?
2. What is the structure of the ctx (ApolloContext) object and what properties can I access from it within resolver functions?
3. How can I debug the resolver logic for the hasSocialLinks field to ensure it returns the expected boolean value?
4. Can I reuse the mappers defined in this file for other types in the schema, or do I need to define separate mappers for each type extension?
5. What are the best practices for handling default resolver logic using the defaultResolver function?
