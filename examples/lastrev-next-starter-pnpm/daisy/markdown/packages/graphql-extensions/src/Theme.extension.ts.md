Summary:
This file contains code for a GraphQL extension that normalizes color values from a CMS by lowercasing the color and removing anything after the first underscore. It also includes a mapping feature for color values. The file exports mappers for various content models and resolvers for the 'Content' type.

Import statements:
- `getLocalizedField` from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': A function for retrieving localized fields from a Contentful instance.
- `ApolloContext` from '@last-rev/types': A type definition for the Apollo context.
- `defaultResolver` from './utils/defaultResolver': A utility function for resolving default values.

typeDef List:
- `mappers`: A list of mappers for different content models.
- `resolvers`: Resolvers for the 'Content' type.

Mappers:
- Each mapper is used for a specific content model and includes resolvers for 'backgroundColor' and 'color' fields. It uses the `defaultResolver` for 'backgroundColor' and the custom `colorResolver` for 'color' field normalization.

External Functions:
- `colorResolver`: A function that normalizes color values and includes a mapping feature. It takes the field name and an optional 'root' parameter and returns a resolver function.
- `mappers`: An object containing mappers for different content models, each with resolvers for 'backgroundColor' and 'color' fields.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by providing custom resolvers for color fields in various content models. It also extends the auto-generated schema to handle color normalization and mapping.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add a new content model and use the color normalization and mapping feature?
2. How can I debug the colorResolver function to understand its behavior?
3. What is the structure of the mappers object and how do I add new mappers for different content models?
4. How does the colorResolver interact with the getLocalizedField function from the Apollo context?
5. How can I test the behavior of the colorResolver and mappers in isolation?
