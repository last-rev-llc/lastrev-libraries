Summary:
This file contains a GraphQL schema extension for the Query type, adding a custom field `contentPreview`. It also exports type mappings and resolvers for the contentPreview query.

Import statements:
- `ApolloContext` from `@last-rev/types`: This is used to define the context for Apollo Server.
- `gql` from `graphql-tag`: This is used to define GraphQL schema.
- `deepMerge` from `./utils/deepMerge`: A utility function for deep merging objects.
- `createType` from `./utils/createType`: A utility function for creating a custom type.

typeDef List:
- `typeDefs` defines the GraphQL schema extension for the Query type, adding the `contentPreview` field.

Mappers:
- `typeMappings`: An empty object used for type mappings.

External Functions:
- `resolvers.Query.contentPreview`: This function handles the logic for the `contentPreview` query. It takes in parameters `id`, `locale`, `displayType`, and `overrideContent`, and the context `ctx: ApolloContext`. It sets the preview mode and locale in the context, loads content using loaders, and merges content with overrideContent if provided.

Interaction Summary:
This file extends the Query type in the GraphQL schema by adding the `contentPreview` field. It also provides resolvers for the contentPreview query, allowing the application to fetch content with preview and override options.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the typeMappings used in the larger application?
2. What are the possible values for displayType in the contentPreview query?
3. How can developers debug issues related to the loaders used in the contentPreview resolver?
4. What is the expected structure of the overrideContent parameter in the contentPreview query?
5. How does the deepMerge function from utils/deepMerge work and when should it be used?
