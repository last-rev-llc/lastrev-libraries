Summary:
This file contains code related to generating paths for different content types in a larger application. It includes functions for generating parent paths, creating full paths, and handling blog landing page slugs. The code exports a `pathsConfigs` object that maps content types to their respective path generation functions.

Import statements:
- `getDefaultFieldValue` from `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core`: A function for getting the default field value from a contentful entry.
- `ContentfulLoaders` and `ContentfulPathsGenerator` from `@last-rev/types`: Types related to contentful loaders and path generation.
- `Entry` from `contentful`: Type representing a contentful entry.
- `createPath` from `./utils/createPath`: A utility function for creating paths.

typeDef List:
- `ContentfulPathsGenerator`: A type representing a function for generating paths for contentful entries.

Mappers:
- `page`: Generates paths for page content type.
- `blog`: Generates paths for blog content type.
- `person`: Generates paths for person content type.
- `categoryBlog`: Generates paths for categoryBlog content type.

External Functions:
1. `generateParentPaths`:
   - Description: Recursively generates parent paths for a given content item.
   - Parameters: 
     - `content`: The content item for which to generate parent paths.
     - `loaders`: Contentful loaders for fetching entries.
     - `defaultLocale`: The default locale for the paths.
     - `preview`: Boolean flag for preview mode.
     - `paths`: Array of parent paths.
   - Returns: A promise resolving to an array of parent paths.

2. `generatePaths`:
   - Description: Generates paths for a given content item.
   - Parameters: 
     - `contentItem`: The content item for which to generate paths.
     - `loaders`: Contentful loaders for fetching entries.
     - `defaultLocale`: The default locale for the paths.
     - `_locales`: Array of locales.
     - `preview`: Boolean flag for preview mode.
     - `_site`: Site information.
   - Returns: A promise resolving to an object containing the generated paths.

Interaction Summary:
The `generatePaths` function interacts with contentful loaders to fetch parent entries and generate paths based on the content model. The `pathsConfigs` object provides a mapping of content types to their respective path generation functions, allowing other parts of the application to easily generate paths for different content types.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the paths generated for different content types?
2. What is the interaction between the path generation functions and the contentful loaders?
3. How can we customize the path generation logic for specific content types?
4. What are the implications of using the `excludeFromLocale` field in path generation?
5. How can we handle errors or edge cases in the path generation process?
