Summary:
This file contains GraphQL type definitions and resolvers for adding JSON-LD schema to different content types such as Page, Blog, and Person. It uses helper functions to retrieve localized fields and resolve paths, and it interacts with other parts of the application to load entry and asset data.

Import statements:
- gql from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function from the graphql-tag library for defining GraphQL schemas.
- getLocalizedField from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports a function for retrieving localized fields from contentful entries.
- resolveField from './utils/resolveField': Imports a function for resolving fields from contentful entries.
- type { BlogPosting as LdBlogPosting, Person as LdPerson, WebPage as LdWebPage } from 'schema-dts': Imports type definitions for BlogPosting, Person, and WebPage from the schema-dts library.
- pathResolver from './utils/pathResolver': Imports a function for resolving paths for contentful entries.

typeDef List:
- extend type Page: Extends the Page type with a jsonLd field of type JSON.
- extend type Blog: Extends the Blog type with a jsonLd field of type JSON.
- extend type Person: Extends the Person type with a jsonLd field of type JSON.
- extend type Card: Extends the Card type with a jsonLd field of type JSON.

Mappers:
- Page: Defines a resolver for the jsonLd field, which constructs a JSON-LD schema for a web page.
- Blog: Defines a resolver for the jsonLd field, which constructs a JSON-LD schema for a blog post.
- Person: Defines a resolver for the jsonLd field, which currently returns an empty JSON object.

External Functions:
- jsonLd resolver for Page: Retrieves localized fields, resolves paths, and constructs a JSON-LD schema for a web page.
- jsonLd resolver for Blog: Retrieves localized fields, resolves paths, loads author and image data, and constructs a JSON-LD schema for a blog post.
- jsonLd resolver for Person: Currently returns an empty JSON object.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the GraphQL schema for Page, Blog, Person, and Card types with a jsonLd field. It uses helper functions to retrieve localized fields, resolve paths, and load entry and asset data. The constructed JSON-LD schemas are used to enhance the structured data for web pages and blog posts.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the localized fields retrieved and handled for different content types?
2. How are paths resolved for contentful entries, and what data is used for constructing the JSON-LD schema?
3. How can the JSON-LD schema be customized or extended for different use cases?
4. How can the resolvers be tested and debugged to ensure the correct JSON-LD schema is generated for different content types?
