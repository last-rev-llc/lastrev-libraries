External Functions:
1. `getVideoEmbedUrl(assetURL: string)`: This function takes an asset URL as input and returns the embed URL for the video based on the platform (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook) of the video. If the asset URL is not a string or does not match any supported platform, the function returns null.

2. `getThumbnailURL(assetURL: string)`: This function takes an asset URL as input and returns the thumbnail URL for the video based on the platform (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook) of the video. If the asset URL is not a string or does not match any supported platform, the function returns null.

Interaction Summary:
These utility functions can be used within a larger application to dynamically generate embed URLs and thumbnail URLs for videos based on the provided asset URLs. They can be integrated into the application's video content management system or media player components to display videos from different platforms seamlessly.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I handle unsupported video platforms or invalid asset URLs when using these functions?
2. Are there any performance considerations when using these functions to generate embed URLs and thumbnail URLs for a large number of videos?
3. Can these functions be extended to support additional video platforms in the future, and how would that impact the existing codebase?
4. What are the best practices for caching or optimizing the retrieval of embed URLs and thumbnail URLs using these functions?
