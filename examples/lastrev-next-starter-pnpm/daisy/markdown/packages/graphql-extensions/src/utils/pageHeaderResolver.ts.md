Summary:
The provided code file is a resolver function for the page header in a GraphQL schema. It uses the `resolveField` function to handle the resolution of the headerOverride and site.header fields. It also interacts with the `getLocalizedField` function from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package and the `entryLoader` from the `@last-rev/types` package to load and retrieve the localized header content for a specific site.

Import statements:
The file imports the `getLocalizedField` function from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package and the `ApolloContext` type from the `@last-rev/types` package. It also imports the `resolveField` function from a local file named `resolveField`.

It also interacts with the `getLocalizedField` function from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package and the `entryLoader` from the `@last-rev/types` package to load and retrieve the localized header content for a specific site.

Developer Questions:
1. How does the `resolveField` function work and what is its purpose in this context?
2. What is the structure of the `ctx` object and what properties does it contain?
3. How does the `entryLoader` from the `@last-rev/types` package interact with the GraphQL schema to load site data?
4. How can I debug the resolution of the headerOverride and site.header fields in the GraphQL schema using this resolver?
