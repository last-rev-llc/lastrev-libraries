Summary:
The provided code file contains utility functions for pruning empty or unnecessary values from a JavaScript object. The main function, `pruneEmpty`, recursively removes undefined, null, NaN, and empty string values from the object. It also removes empty arrays and recursively prunes nested objects. The file also includes helper functions for checking if a value is object-like, checking if an object is empty, and deep cloning an object.

Import statements:
The file does not contain any import statements as it does not rely on external dependencies.

External Functions:
1. `pruneEmpty(obj: any): any`: This function takes an object as input and recursively removes empty or unnecessary values from it. It returns the pruned object.

2. `isObjectLike(value: any): boolean`: This function checks if the input value is object-like (i.e., it is of type 'object' and not null). It returns a boolean indicating whether the value is object-like.

3. `isEmpty(obj: any): boolean`: This function checks if the input object is empty. If the input is an array, it checks if the array is empty. If the input is an object, it checks if the object has no keys. It returns a boolean indicating whether the object is empty.

4. `cloneDeep(obj: any): any`: This function performs a deep clone of the input object using JSON serialization and deserialization. It returns the cloned object.

Interaction Summary:
The `pruneEmpty` function can be used within the context of a larger application to clean up and sanitize input data before processing or storing it. For example, it can be used to remove unnecessary or empty fields from incoming GraphQL mutations or queries before persisting the data in a database. It can also be used to clean up response data before sending it to clients.

Developer Questions:
1. How does the `pruneEmpty` function handle nested objects and arrays?
2. What are the performance implications of using `cloneDeep` for large objects?
3. How can the `pruneEmpty` function be integrated into GraphQL resolvers to sanitize input data?
4. What are the potential edge cases or unexpected behaviors when using the `pruneEmpty` function?
5. How can the `isEmpty` function be used to optimize conditional checks in other parts of the application?
