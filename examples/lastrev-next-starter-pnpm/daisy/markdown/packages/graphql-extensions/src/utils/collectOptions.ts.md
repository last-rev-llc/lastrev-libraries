Summary:
The provided code file contains TypeScript code for a function called `collectOptions` and a helper function called `toOption`. The `collectOptions` function takes in filters, items, and a context object, and returns a promise of an object containing options for each filter. The `toOption` function is a helper function used within `collectOptions` to transform values into Option objects.

Import statements:
The file imports the `getLocalizedField` function from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package, the `ApolloContext` type from the `@last-rev/types` package, and the `uniqBy` function from a local file called `uniqBy`.

Interaction Summary:
The `collectOptions` function interacts with the rest of the application by asynchronously collecting options based on the provided filters, items, and context. It uses the `getLocalizedField` function from the `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core` package to retrieve localized fields from the items.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use the `collectOptions` function in my GraphQL resolvers or queries?
2. What are the expected structures for the filters and items parameters when calling `collectOptions`?
3. How can I debug the transformation of values into Option objects using the `toOption` function?
4. What is the expected behavior when calling `collectOptions` with different combinations of filters and items?
5. How does the `collectOptions` function handle errors or exceptions during the asynchronous processing?
