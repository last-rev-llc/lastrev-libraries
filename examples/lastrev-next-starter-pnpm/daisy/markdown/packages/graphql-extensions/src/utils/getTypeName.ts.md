It provides utility functions for manipulating strings and deriving type names from content types, which can be useful in defining a custom GraphQL schema and extending the auto-generated schema to suit specific needs.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use the capitalizeFirst function in my code?
2. What is the expected input format for the contentType parameter in the getTypeName function?
3. How does the getTypeName function handle different types of input (Contentful content type vs. string)?
4. Are there any edge cases or potential errors to consider when using these utility functions?
5. How can I debug issues related to type name derivation from Contentful content types using this code?
