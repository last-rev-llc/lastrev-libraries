Summary:
This file contains GraphQL schema extensions, resolvers, and utility functions related to handling media and asset data within a larger application. It includes type definitions for extending the Media and Asset types, mappers for customizing resolver behavior, and functions for resolving media fields and files.

Import statements:
- `gql` from 'graphql-tag': A function for creating GraphQL query strings with syntax highlighting and linting.
- `getLocalizedField` from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': A utility function for retrieving localized fields from a contentful entry.
- `ApolloContext` from '@last-rev/types': A type definition for the Apollo context object.
- `getVideoEmbedUrl` from './utils/getVideoEmbedUrl': A utility function for generating an embeddable video URL.
- `cleanSVG` from './utils/cleanSVG': A utility function for cleaning up SVG content.

typeDef List:
- Media: Extends the Media type with additional fields 'alt', 'variant', 'fileTablet', and 'fileMobile'.
- Asset: Extends the Asset type with the field 'svgContent'.

Mappers:
- Asset: Defines custom resolvers for the Asset type, including the 'url' field.
- Media: Defines custom resolvers for the Media type, including 'variant', 'title', 'file', 'fileTablet', and 'fileMobile'.

External Functions:
1. mediaFieldResolver
   - Description: Resolves media fields and asset references, handling localization and loading asset data.
   - Parameters: fields (object), field (string), assetField (string), ctx (ApolloContext)
   - Returns: Promise<any>

2. resolveFile
   - Description: Resolves the file for a media object, handling asset references and generating video embed URLs.
   - Parameters: media (object), _args (any), ctx (ApolloContext)
   - Returns: Promise<any>

Interaction Summary:
This file extends the GraphQL schema by adding custom fields to the Media and Asset types. It provides custom resolvers for these types to handle specific field resolution logic, such as retrieving localized fields, generating embeddable video URLs, and cleaning SVG content. The utility functions and resolvers defined in this file interact with the larger application by providing a way to handle media and asset data in a flexible and customizable manner.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add custom fields to the Media and Asset types in the GraphQL schema?
2. What is the purpose of the mediaFieldResolver function, and how is it used to resolve media fields and asset references?
3. How can I customize the behavior of field resolvers for the Media and Asset types using the mappers defined in this file?
4. What are the utility functions getVideoEmbedUrl and cleanSVG used for, and how can I use them in my code?
5. How do the typeDefs, mappers, and resolvers in this file interact with the overall GraphQL schema and data fetching process in the application?
