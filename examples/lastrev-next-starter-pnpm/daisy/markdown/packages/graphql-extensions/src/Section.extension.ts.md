Summary:
The provided code file is an extension for defining custom GraphQL schema for the Section type. It extends the Section type by adding custom fields and changing resolver behavior. It also includes type mappings and mappers for the Section type.

Import statements:
The file imports functions and types from various packages:
- `getLocalizedField` from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': A function for retrieving localized fields from a contentful entry.
- `ApolloContext` from '@last-rev/types': A type representing the context for Apollo GraphQL operations.
- `gql` from 'graphql-tag': A function for creating GraphQL query strings.
- `defaultResolver` from './utils/defaultResolver': A utility function for resolving default values.

typeDef List:
The typeDefs object defines the custom schema for the Section type. It extends the Section type by adding the following fields:
- contents: An array of Content type
- background: A Media type
- introText: A Text type
- hasBackground: A Boolean type

Mappers:
- Section: The mappers object contains a mapper for the Section type. It defines resolver functions for the fields of the Section type. The 'hasBackground' resolver checks if the 'background' field is present and returns a Boolean value. The 'variant' field uses the defaultResolver function to resolve the 'variant' field.

External Functions:
- hasBackground: async (section: any, _args: any, ctx: ApolloContext) => boolean
  - Parameters: section (any), _args (any), ctx (ApolloContext)
  - Returns: A boolean value indicating whether the 'background' field is present in the section.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the Section type in the GraphQL schema. It adds custom fields and resolver functions for the Section type, allowing for customized behavior when querying Section objects.

Developer Questions:
- How can I add additional custom fields to the Section type using this extension?
- What is the purpose of the defaultResolver function and how can I use it in my own resolvers?
- How can I debug resolver functions defined in the mappers object when encountering issues with field resolution?
