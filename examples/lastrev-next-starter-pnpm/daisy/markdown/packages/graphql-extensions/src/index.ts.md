Summary:
This file is responsible for loading GraphQL extensions from the file system, merging their type definitions and resolvers, and exporting them for use in a larger GraphQL schema. It also handles merging mappers, type mappings, and paths configurations from the loaded extensions.

Import statements:
- `mergeTypeDefs` and `mergeResolvers` from `@graphql-tools/merge`: These are used to merge type definitions and resolvers from multiple sources.
- `Source`, `DocumentNode`, and `GraphQLSchema` from `graphql`: These are GraphQL types used in the code.
- `fs` and `path`: These are Node.js modules used for file system operations.
- `deepMerge` from `./utils/deepMerge`: A custom utility function for deep merging objects.

typeDef List:
- `typeDefs`: Merged type definitions from the loaded extensions.

Mappers:
- `mappers`: Merged mappers from the loaded extensions. These mappers are used to map data from the GraphQL schema to the content model.

External Functions:
- `loadFiles()`: This function loads GraphQL extension files from the file system based on the environment. It returns an array of loaded modules.
- `getNonNullPropertiesFromExtensions(property)`: This function takes a property name and returns an array of non-null values for that property from the loaded extensions.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the file system to dynamically load GraphQL extension files based on the environment. It merges the type definitions and resolvers from the loaded extensions and exports them for use in a larger GraphQL schema. It also merges mappers, type mappings, and paths configurations from the loaded extensions.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the GraphQL extension files loaded dynamically based on the environment?
2. What is the structure of the merged type definitions and resolvers exported from this file?
3. How are mappers, type mappings, and paths configurations used in the larger application, and how are they merged from the loaded extensions?
4. How can developers debug issues related to loading and merging GraphQL extensions in this file?
