Developer Questions:
1. How do I add additional custom fields to other types in the GraphQL schema?
2. What is the purpose of the defaultResolver function and how can I customize resolver behavior for other fields?
3. How can I test the functionality of the added custom fields and the resolver in the GraphQL schema?
4. What are the implications of extending the schema on existing queries and mutations in the application?
