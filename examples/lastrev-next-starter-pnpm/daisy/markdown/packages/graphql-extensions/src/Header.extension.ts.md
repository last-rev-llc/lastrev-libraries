Summary:
This file contains code for extending the GraphQL schema by adding custom fields to the Header type. It also includes mappers for defining resolver behavior for the added fields.

Import statements:
- gql from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function for defining GraphQL schemas.
- getLocalizedField from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports a function for retrieving localized fields from a content model.
- ApolloContext from '@last-rev/types': Imports the ApolloContext type for defining the context object in Apollo Server.
- defaultResolver from './utils/defaultResolver': Imports a default resolver function from a utility file.

typeDef List:
- Header: Extends the Header type with custom fields including logo, logoUrl, navigationItems, ctaItems, supernavLink, supernavIcon, and hasCtaItems.

Mappers:
- Header: Defines resolver behavior for the custom fields added to the Header type. It includes a resolver for hasCtaItems and backgroundColor.

External Functions:
- hasCtaItems: A resolver function that checks if the ctaItems field is present in the header and returns a boolean value.
  - Parameters: header (any), _args (any), ctx (ApolloContext)
  - Returns: Boolean

- backgroundColor: A default resolver function for the backgroundColor field.
  - Parameters: None
  - Returns: Resolver function for backgroundColor field

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the Header type in the GraphQL schema with custom fields and defining resolver behavior for those fields. It relies on the getLocalizedField function from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core' to retrieve localized fields from the content model.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add additional custom fields to other types in the GraphQL schema?
2. What is the structure of the ctx (ApolloContext) object and what information does it contain?
3. How can I debug resolver functions defined in the mappers?
4. What is the purpose of the defaultResolver function and when should it be used?
5. How can I test the behavior of the extended Header type in GraphQL queries?
