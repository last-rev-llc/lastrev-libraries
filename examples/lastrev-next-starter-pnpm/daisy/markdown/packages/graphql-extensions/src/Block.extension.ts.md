Summary:
This file contains code for extending the GraphQL schema by adding custom fields to the Block type. It also includes mappers for customizing resolver behavior for the Block type.

Import statements:
- `gql` from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function for defining GraphQL schemas.
- `defaultResolver` from './utils/defaultResolver': Imports a default resolver function from a utility file.
- `ApolloContext` and `Mappers` from '@last-rev/types': Imports types for Apollo context and mappers.
- `getLocalizedField` from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports a function for getting localized fields from Contentful.

typeDef List:
- Block: Extends the Block type with custom fields introText, mediaItems, actions, link, supplementalContent, and backgroundImage.

Mappers:
- Block: Defines custom resolver behavior for the Block type, including the variant and mediaItems fields.

External Functions:
- `defaultResolver(field: string)`: This function is used to create a default resolver for a given field. It takes the field name as a parameter and returns a resolver function.
- `getLocalizedField(fields: any, fieldName: string, ctx: ApolloContext)`: This function is used to get a localized field from Contentful. It takes the fields, field name, and Apollo context as parameters and returns the localized field.

Interaction Summary:
This file extends the Block type in the GraphQL schema by adding custom fields and customizing resolver behavior. It interacts with the Apollo context and Contentful to retrieve and process localized fields.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add custom fields to other types in the GraphQL schema?
2. How can I debug the resolver behavior for the Block type?
3. What are the available fields and methods in the ApolloContext object?
4. How can I test the behavior of the mappers in different scenarios?
5. What are the possible issues that may arise when interacting with Contentful for localized fields?
