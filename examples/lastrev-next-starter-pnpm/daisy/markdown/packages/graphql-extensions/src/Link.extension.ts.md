Summary:
This file contains code related to extending the GraphQL schema by adding custom fields and changing resolver behavior for the Link type. It includes type definitions, mappers for resolver functions, and utility functions for resolving href and target fields for links.

Import statements:
- gql from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function for defining GraphQL schemas.
- getLocalizedField from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports a function for getting localized fields from a contentful entry.
- Mappers, ApolloContext from '@last-rev/types': Imports types for mappers and Apollo context.
- createPath, defaultResolver, camelCase from './utils': Imports utility functions for creating paths, default resolver behavior, and camel casing.
- TargetMapping: Defines a type for mapping target values.

typeDef List:
- Link: Extends the Link type with additional fields href, icon, and iconPosition.

Mappers:
- Link: Defines resolver functions for the href, target, and variant fields of the Link type.
- NavigationItem: Defines resolver functions for the link, children, and variant fields of the NavigationItem type.

External Functions:
1. hrefUrlResolver:
   - Parameters: link (any), _: never, ctx (ApolloContext)
   - Returns: Promise<string>
   - Description: Resolves the href field for a link by checking localized fields for href, manualUrl, and linkedContent. It also handles resolving asset URLs for media content.

2. targetResolver:
   - Parameters: link (any), _: never, ctx (ApolloContext)
   - Returns: Promise<string>
   - Description: Resolves the target field for a link by mapping target values to corresponding HTML target attributes.

Interaction Summary:
This file extends the Link and NavigationItem types in the GraphQL schema by adding custom fields and resolver functions. It interacts with the rest of the application by providing custom resolver logic for handling link href and target values.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add custom fields to the Link type in the GraphQL schema?
2. What resolver functions are available for customizing the behavior of link fields?
3. How can I debug resolver functions for the Link and NavigationItem types?
4. What are the expected input parameters for the hrefUrlResolver and targetResolver functions?
5. How can I use the utility functions from the 'utils' module in my own resolver functions?
