Summary:
This file contains code for extending a custom GraphQL schema by adding custom fields, changing resolver behavior, and handling mapping. It includes type definitions, mappers, resolvers, and external functions for handling navigation items, sub-navigation items, and links within a larger application.

Import statements:
- gql from 'graphql-tag': Imports the gql function from the 'graphql-tag' package for defining GraphQL schemas.
- getLocalizedField from '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core': Imports the getLocalizedField function from the '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core' package for retrieving localized fields from contentful data.
- ApolloContext from '@last-rev/types': Imports the ApolloContext type from the '@last-rev/types' package for defining the context object used in Apollo Server.
- createPath from './utils/createPath': Imports the createPath function from the './utils/createPath' file for creating paths.
- pascalCase from './utils/pascalCase': Imports the pascalCase function from the './utils/pascalCase' file for converting strings to pascal case.
- defaultResolver from './utils/defaultResolver': Imports the defaultResolver function from the './utils/defaultResolver' file for handling default resolver behavior.

typeDef List:
- NavigationItem: Extends the type NavigationItem with custom fields such as actions, navMedia, subNavigation, href, summary, icon, and iconPosition.
- SubNavigationItem: Defines a union type for sub-navigation items, including Link, NavigationItem, Page, Person, and Blog.

Mappers:
- NavigationItem: Defines resolvers for the NavigationItem type, including the href field using the hrefUrlResolver function and the variant field using the defaultResolver function.
- Link: Defines resolvers for the Link type, including the href field using the hrefUrlResolver function and the variant field using the defaultResolver function.

External Functions:
- hrefUrlResolver: A function that resolves the href URL for a given link based on the content reference, manual URL, or asset data. It takes the link object, context object (ctx), and returns a Promise of the resolved URL.
  Parameters: link (any), _: never, ctx (ApolloContext)
  Returns: Promise<string>

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the GraphQL schema with custom fields for NavigationItem and defining resolvers for handling navigation items and links. It also interacts with the contentful data through the getLocalizedField function to retrieve localized fields and loaders for fetching entry and asset data.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add custom fields to the NavigationItem type?
2. How does the hrefUrlResolver function handle different types of links and content references?
3. What is the purpose of the SubNavigationItem union type and how is it used in the application?
4. How can I debug the resolver behavior for NavigationItem and Link types?
5. What are the dependencies for the external functions used in this file, and how do I handle errors related to these dependencies?
