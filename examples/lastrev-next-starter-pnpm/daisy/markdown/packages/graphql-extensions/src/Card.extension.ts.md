Summary:
This file contains GraphQL type definitions, mappers, and some commented out code for extending the Card type and handling media-related fields. It also includes type mappings and a GraphQL type definition for the Card type.

Import statements:
- `getLocalizedField` from `@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core`: A function for getting localized fields from a Contentful entry.
- `ApolloContext` from `@last-rev/types`: A type representing the context object for Apollo Server.
- `gql` from `graphql-tag`: A function for creating GraphQL query strings.

typeDef List:
- Card: Extends the Card type with fields for actions, link, and variant.

Mappers:
- Media: Contains mappers for the media and variant fields. The media mapper retrieves the featured media using the `getLocalizedField` function and the variant mapper sets the variant field to 'media'.

External Functions:
- `getLocalizedField(media: any, field: string, ctx: ApolloContext)`: Retrieves a localized field from a Contentful entry.
  - Parameters: `media` (any), `field` (string), `ctx` (ApolloContext)
  - Returns: The localized field value.

Interaction Summary:
This file extends the Card type in the GraphQL schema by adding fields for actions, link, and variant. It also includes mappers for the Media type, which handle the retrieval of media and setting the variant field.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the typeMappings used within the larger application?
2. What is the purpose of the commented out code for the Blog type, and how does it interact with the rest of the application?
3. How are the utils functions like `createRichText`, `getSlug`, and `getThumbnailURL` used within the larger application?
4. How are the queries using the extended Card type constructed and executed within the larger application?
