Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by extending the Collection type in the GraphQL schema and providing custom resolvers for handling various fields of the Collection type. It also interacts with utility functions for querying contentful, collecting options, and logging errors.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the custom fields for the Collection type defined and used in the application?
2. How are the utility functions such as queryContentful and collectOptions integrated with the Collection type?
3. How are errors logged and handled within the mappers and resolvers for the Collection type?
4. How can developers debug issues related to resolving the variant and items for a collection?
