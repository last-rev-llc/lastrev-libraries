Summary:
This file contains GraphQL code that extends the type `CollectionExpandableItem` by adding custom fields `content` and `body`. It also includes a mapper for `CollectionExpandableItem` that defines custom resolver behavior for the `content` field.

Import statements:
- `gql` from `graphql-tag`: This library is used to define GraphQL queries and schemas.
- `ApolloContext` and `Mappers` from `@last-rev/types`: These are custom types and interfaces used in the application.

typeDef List:
- `extend type CollectionExpandableItem`: This extends the `CollectionExpandableItem` type by adding the fields `content` of type `Content` and `body` of type `RichText`.

Mappers:
- `CollectionExpandableItem`: This mapper defines custom resolver behavior for the `content` field of the `CollectionExpandableItem` type. It includes a commented-out resolver function that checks for the existence of `bodyRte` and `content` fields in the `collectionExpandableItem` object and returns the appropriate content.

External Functions:
- No external functions are present in this file.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger GraphQL schema by extending the `CollectionExpandableItem` type with additional fields. It also defines custom resolver behavior for the `content` field, which may affect how data is retrieved and processed when querying for `CollectionExpandableItem` objects.

Developer Questions:
1. How does the `content` resolver function handle the retrieval of localized fields?
2. What is the expected behavior when both `bodyRte` and `content` fields exist in the `collectionExpandableItem` object?
3. How does the extended `CollectionExpandableItem` type affect existing queries and resolvers in the application?
