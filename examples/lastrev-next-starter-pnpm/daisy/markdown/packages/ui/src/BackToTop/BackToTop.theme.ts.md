### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles for the BackToTop component using Material UI. It includes default props, root styles, and variants for the BackToTop component.

### Import statements:
The file imports the following types from '@mui/material/styles':
- ThemeOptions: The options for the theme.

### Default Props List:
The default props for the BackToTop component are defined as an empty object:
```javascript
const defaultProps: ComponentsProps['BackToTop'] = {};
```

### Root Styles:
The root style for the BackToTop component is defined as a function that takes the theme and a 'visible' parameter. It sets the position to 'fixed', bottom and right to the specified spacing from the theme, adds a transition effect, sets the z-index, and applies a transform based on the 'visible' parameter:
```javascript
const styleOverrides: ComponentsOverrides<Theme>['BackToTop'] = {
  root: ({ theme, visible }) => ({
    position: 'fixed',
    bottom: theme.spacing(2),
    right: theme.spacing(2),
    transition: '0.3s ease-in-out',
    zIndex: 2,
    transform: `translateY(${visible ? 0 : 100}px)`
  })
};
```

### Variants:
The file includes a function createVariants that returns an empty array for the BackToTop component. This suggests that there are no specific variants defined for the BackToTop component in this file.
