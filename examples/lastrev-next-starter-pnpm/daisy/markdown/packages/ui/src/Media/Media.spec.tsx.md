### Known Issues and Todo Items:
- There is a TODO comment to fix a test related to rendering file in an iframe when the variant is embed. This needs to be addressed.
- The file does not handle event handlers or state management, which may be required for certain interactions with the media content. Developers may need to consider adding these features if necessary.
