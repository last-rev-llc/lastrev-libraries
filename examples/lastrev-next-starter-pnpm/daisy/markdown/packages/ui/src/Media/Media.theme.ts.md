### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles for the Media component in a Material UI application. It includes default props, root styles, and variants for the Media component.

### Import statements:
The file imports the following types from '@mui/material/styles':
- ThemeOptions: The options for the theme.
- ComponentsProps: The props for the components.
- ComponentsOverrides: The overrides for the components.
- ComponentsVariants: The variants for the components.

It also imports the Theme type from '@ui/ThemeRegistry/theme.types', which likely contains the custom theme for the application.

### Default Props List:
The default props for the Media component are defined as follows:
- nextImageOptimization: true
- priority: false
- sizes: '100vw'

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the Media component are defined as follows:
- display: 'block'
- maxWidth: `100%`
- height: 'auto'

These styles ensure that the media component is displayed as a block element, with a maximum width of 100% and an auto-adjusting height.

### Variants:
The file defines a function createVariants that returns an empty array for the Media component variants. This suggests that there are no specific variants defined in this file.

### Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the theme options for the Media component. Other components or pages that use the Media component will inherit these styles and props when the theme is applied.

### Developer Questions:
Developers working with this component may have the following questions when debugging:
- How are the default props being used in the Media component?
- Are there any other theme files that may override or extend the styles defined here?
- How can I add new variants for the Media component and apply them in the application?
