### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles for the Material-UI Link component. It includes default props, root styles, and variants for different link styles.

### Import statements:
The file imports the following types from `@mui/material/styles` and `@ui/ThemeRegistry/theme.types`:
- `ThemeOptions`
- `ComponentsProps`
- `ComponentsOverrides`
- `ComponentsVariants`
- `Theme`

### Default Props List:
The default props for the Link component are defined as an empty object.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the Link component are defined using the `styleOverrides` object. The `root` style is a function that takes `ownerState` and `theme` as parameters and sets the display, color, and background color based on the variant of the link. The `noLinkStyleIcon` style is also defined as a function that takes `theme` and `iconPosition` as parameters and sets the margin based on the icon position.

### Variants:
The file defines three variants for the Link component:
1. `link`: Sets the text decoration to underline.
2. `default`: Sets the text decoration to underline.
3. `text`: Sets the text decoration to underline.

### Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the styles for the Link component. Other components or pages that use the Link component will inherit these styles.

### Developer Questions:
1. How are the theme variables like `--mui-palette-primary-contrastText` and `--mui-palette-primary-main` defined and where are they used in the application?
2. How can I add a new variant for the Link component and define its styles?
3. What is the purpose of the `ownerState` parameter in the `root` style function and how is it used?
4. How are the theme and ownerState passed to the `root` style function from the Link component?

This technical document provides a detailed breakdown of the theme file, including its imports, default props, root styles, variants, interaction with the application, and potential developer questions.
