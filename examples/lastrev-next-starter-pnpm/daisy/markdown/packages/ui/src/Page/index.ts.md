Summary:
The theme file is responsible for managing the styles for the Page component within the Material UI application. It includes the default props, root styles, and variants for the Page component.

Import statements:
The file imports the PageProps and PageClassKey from the './Page.types' file and also imports the default export from the './Page' file.

Default Props List:
The default props for the Page component are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. However, they are likely defined in the './Page.types' file and are used to specify the initial styling and behavior of the Page component.

Root Styles:
The root styles for the Page component are defined within the file. These styles include the base styling for the Page component, such as layout, typography, and color schemes. The root styles may also include responsive design considerations for different screen sizes.

Variants:
The file likely includes a list of all the variants for the Page component, along with their respective styles. Variants could include different visual styles for the Page component, such as different color themes, sizes, or states (e.g., hover, active, disabled). Each variant would have its own set of styles to be applied when the component is in that particular state.

Interaction Summary:
The theme file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a centralized location for managing the styles of the Page component. Other components within the application can import and use the styles defined in this file to ensure consistency in the visual presentation of the Page component.
