Interaction Summary:
These fragments are likely to be used in the context of a larger GraphQL schema that defines the structure of a website or application. They can be included in queries to fetch specific fields for a page or its card representation. The fragments may be used in conjunction with resolvers to fetch data from a data source and populate the fields defined in the fragments.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use these fragments in my GraphQL queries to fetch specific fields for a page or its card representation?
2. What are the expected types for each field defined in the fragments, and how should I handle them in my client-side code?
3. Are there any specific resolvers or data sources that these fragments rely on, and how can I debug issues related to fetching data for the fields defined in the fragments?
