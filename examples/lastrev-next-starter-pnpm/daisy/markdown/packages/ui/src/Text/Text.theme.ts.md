### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles for the Text component in a Material UI application. It includes default props, root styles, and variants with their respective styles.

### Import statements:
- `ThemeOptions`, `ComponentsProps`, `ComponentsOverrides`, `ComponentsVariants` from `@mui/material/styles`: These are types and interfaces provided by Material UI for defining theme options, component props, overrides, and variants.
- `Theme` from `@ui/ThemeRegistry/theme.types`: This is a custom type representing the theme used in the application.
- `TextVariants` from `./Text.types`: This is an enum defining different variants for the Text component.

### Default Props List:
- `defaultProps`: Defines the default props for the Text component, setting the variant to `TextVariants.default`.

### Root Styles:
- `styleOverrides`: Defines the root styles for the Text component. It includes static styles for the root, title, and subtitle. The root style sets static styles for width, display, and list indentation. The title and subtitle styles are defined based on the variant using the theme's typography.

### Variants:
- `createVariants`: Defines two variants for the Text component - 'inline' and 'introText'. Each variant has specific styles defined based on the variant prop.

### Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the styles for the Text component. Other components using the Text component will inherit these styles based on the theme configuration.
