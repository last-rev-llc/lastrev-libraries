Summary:
The provided code file contains GraphQL fragments that define various fields and their relationships for the "Text" type. These fragments are used to structure and retrieve specific data related to text content within a larger GraphQL schema.

Import statements:
The code does not contain any import statements as it is a collection of GraphQL fragments and does not include any external dependencies.

typeDef List:
The file does not contain type definitions as it is focused on defining fragments for the "Text" type rather than creating new types.

Mappers:
- Text_FieldsFragment: Defines the basic fields for a text content type such as variant, align, overline, title, and subtitle.
- Text_BaseFragment: Extends the Text_FieldsFragment and includes the body field, which is further extended by the RichText_BaseFragment.
- Text_IntroTextFragment: Similar to Text_BaseFragment but includes a specific structure for the body field, extended by the RichText_IntroTextFragment.
- Text_RichTextFragment: Extends the Text_FieldsFragment and includes the body field with rich text content and links to other content entries, creating a nested structure.

External Functions:
The file does not contain any external functions as it is focused on defining GraphQL fragments rather than executable code.

Interaction Summary:
These fragments can be used within GraphQL queries to retrieve specific fields and content structures related to text content. They can be included in larger queries to fetch text data in various formats and with different levels of detail.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use these fragments in my GraphQL queries to retrieve specific text content?
2. What are the available fields and structures defined by these fragments, and how can I customize them for different use cases?
3. How can I debug issues related to fetching and displaying text content using these fragments?
4. What are the performance considerations when using these fragments in GraphQL queries, especially for nested structures like Text_RichTextFragment?
