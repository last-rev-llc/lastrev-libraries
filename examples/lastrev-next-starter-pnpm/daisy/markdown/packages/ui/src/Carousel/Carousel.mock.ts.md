- `cardBaseMock` from `../Card/Card.mock`: Mock data for the card component.
- `CardVariants` from `../Card`: Variants for the card component.
- `introTextMock` from `../Text/Text.mock`: Mock data for the intro text component.
- `randomId` from `../utils/randomId`: Utility function to generate a random ID.
- `CarouselProps` and `CarouselVariants` from `./Carousel.types`: Types and variants for the carousel component.

### Default Props List:

### Interaction Summary:
The `carouselBaseMock` function is used to generate mock data for the carousel component. This mock data can be utilized in unit tests, storybook stories, or during development to simulate the behavior of the carousel component.

### Developer Questions:
1. How can I customize the mock data generated for the carousel component?
2. Are there additional variants for the carousel that can be used in the mock data generation?
3. How does the `introText` mock data get integrated with the carousel component?
4. What is the purpose of the `randomId` utility function in generating the ID for the carousel?
