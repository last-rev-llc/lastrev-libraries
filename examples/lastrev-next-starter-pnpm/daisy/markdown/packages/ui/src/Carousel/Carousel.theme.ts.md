### Summary:
This theme file contains the styles for the Carousel component using Material UI. It includes default props, root styles, and variants for the Carousel component.

### Import statements:
- `Theme`, `ThemeOptions`, `ComponentsProps`, `ComponentsOverrides`, `ComponentsVariants` are imported from `@mui/material/styles`.
- `swiper/css` and `swiper/css/navigation` are imported for styling the carousel.

### Default Props List:
- `defaultProps` is an empty object of type `ComponentsProps['Carousel']`.

### Root Styles:
- The `root` style is defined as a function that takes `theme` and `ownerState` as parameters. It applies various styles such as flexbox layout, width, position, and padding to the root element. It also includes specific styles for the navigation buttons.

### Variants:
- No variants are defined in the code, but the `createVariants` function is provided to create variants for the Carousel component.

### Interaction Summary:
The styles defined in this file will be applied to the Carousel component within the larger application. The root styles will determine the layout and appearance of the Carousel, while the variants (if created) will provide additional style variations.

### Developer Questions:
1. How can I create and apply variants to the Carousel component using the `createVariants` function?
2. What are the specific ownerState properties that can be used to customize the root styles of the Carousel?
3. How do the imported styles from `swiper/css` and `swiper/css/navigation` affect the styling of the Carousel component?
4. Are there any specific theme options or overrides that can be applied to the Carousel component globally within the application?
