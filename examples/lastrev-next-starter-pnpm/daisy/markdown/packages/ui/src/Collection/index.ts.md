Summary:
The theme file is responsible for managing the styles for the Collection component within the Material UI application. It exports the CollectionProps and CollectionClassKey types from the Collection.types file and the default Collection component from the Collection file.

Import statements:
The file likely contains import statements for the CollectionProps and CollectionClassKey types from the Collection.types file, as well as the default Collection component from the Collection file.

Default Props List:
The default props for the Collection component, including any required and optional props, will be listed here. These props define the initial state and behavior of the Collection component.

Root Styles:
The root styles section will include a list of the primary styles applied to the Collection component. This may include styles for the container, typography, spacing, and other foundational elements of the component. A visual description of the style may also be provided to give a better understanding of how the styles will appear in the application.

Variants:
This section will list all the variants available for the Collection component and their associated styles. Variants may include different visual styles for the component based on its state or usage, such as "default," "hovered," "selected," etc. Each variant will be accompanied by a visual description of the style to illustrate its appearance in the application.

Interaction Summary:
