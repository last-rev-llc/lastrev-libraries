Summary:
The theme file `collectionBaseMock` provides a set of default props and styles for the Collection component. It includes default values for the CollectionProps, as well as variants and styles for the Collection component.

Import statements:
- `cardBaseMock` and `CardVariants` from '../Card/Card.mock' and '../Card' respectively: These are used to create mock card data and define card variants.
- `introTextMock` from '../Text/Text.mock': Used to create mock intro text for the Collection component.
- `randomId` from '../utils/randomId': Utilized to generate a random ID for the Collection component.
- `CollectionProps` and `CollectionVariants` from './Collection.types': These are used to define the types and variants for the Collection component.

Default Props List:
- `collectionBaseMock`: A function that returns default props for the Collection component.

Root Styles:
The root styles for the Collection component are not explicitly defined in this file. The styles for the Collection component are likely defined in a separate file or component.

Variants:
- `variant`: The variant of the Collection component, with a default value of `CollectionVariants.threePerRow`.
- `items`: An array of card items, each with a variant that can be overridden.
- `itemsVariant`: The default variant for the card items, with a default value of `CardVariants.default`.
- `introText`: The intro text for the Collection component, with a dynamically generated title based on the variant and itemsVariant.

Interaction Summary:
The `collectionBaseMock` function provides default props and styles for the Collection component. These default props can be used as a starting point when rendering the Collection component within the larger application. Developers can override these default props as needed to customize the appearance and behavior of the Collection component.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I customize the styles and variants of the Collection component using the default props provided by `collectionBaseMock`?
2. Are there any specific requirements or constraints for the data structure of the card items within the Collection component?
3. How can I integrate the intro text generated by `collectionBaseMock` with other text components in the application?
