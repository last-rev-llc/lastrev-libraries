### Summary:
This theme file contains a function `useThemeProps` that is used to manage styles for components within a Material UI application. It utilizes the `useTheme` hook from `@mui/system` to access the current theme and merge default props with custom props for a specific component.

### Import statements:
- `useTheme` from `@mui/system`: This hook is used to access the current theme within the application.
- `ThemedProps` and `ThemeWithProps` from `@mui/system/useThemeProps`: These types are used to define the themed props and theme with props for the `useThemeProps` function.

### Default Props List:
The file does not explicitly export any default props, but it provides a mechanism to merge default props with custom props for a specific component using the `useThemeProps` function.

### Root Styles:
The file does not contain any specific root styles, as it primarily focuses on merging default props with custom props based on the current theme.

### Variants:
The file does not define specific variants, as it is more concerned with managing props and merging default props with custom props based on the current theme.

### Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a centralized mechanism for managing component props based on the current theme. It allows components to access default props defined in the theme and merge them with custom props, ensuring consistency in styling across the application.

### Developer Questions:
1. How are default props defined and accessed within the theme?
2. What is the process for adding new variants and styles to the theme file?
