Summary:
The provided code contains GraphQL fragments for defining form-related data structures within a larger application. It includes two fragments, Form_BaseFragment and Form_PageFragment, which extend the ElementForm type. These fragments define various fields related to forms, such as variant, hubspotPortalId, hubspotFormId, introText, path, slug, header, footer, and footerDisclaimerOverride.

Import statements:
The code does not contain any import statements as it is a GraphQL fragment file and does not include any external dependencies.

typeDef List:
- Form_BaseFragment: Extends the ElementForm type and includes fields such as variant, hubspotPortalId, hubspotFormId, and introText.
- Form_PageFragment: Also extends the ElementForm type and includes additional fields such as path, slug, header, footer, and footerDisclaimerOverride.

Mappers:
- No mappers are present in the provided code.

External Functions:
- No external functions are present in the provided code.

Interaction Summary:
These fragments are likely used within the larger GraphQL schema of the application to define the structure of form-related data. They may be included in queries or mutations related to forms, and the fields defined within these fragments can be accessed and manipulated within the application's GraphQL resolvers.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the Form_BaseFragment and Form_PageFragment fragments used in GraphQL queries or mutations?
2. What are the possible values for the variant field within the Form fragments, and how do they affect form rendering or behavior?
3. How can the hubspotPortalId and hubspotFormId fields be integrated with external services or APIs?
4. What is the purpose of the introText field within the Form_BaseFragment, and how is it typically used in the application?
5. How are the fields defined in these fragments handled within the application's GraphQL resolvers?
