### Summary:
This theme file contains code for managing the styles and default props for a form component within a larger application. It includes functions for generating default mock props and exporting them for use in the application.

### Import statements:
- `introTextMock`: Importing a mock intro text for the form from the `Text` component.
- `randomId`: Importing a utility function for generating random IDs.
- `FormProps`, `FormVariants`: Importing type definitions for form props and variants from the `Form.types` file.

### Default Props List:
- `formDefaultMock`: Function for generating default mock props for the form component.
- `formBaseMock`: Function for exporting the default mock props.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the form component are not explicitly defined in this file. It appears that the root styles may be managed elsewhere in the application.

### Variants:
- `FormVariants.default`: The default variant for the form component. It is not explicitly defined in this file, but it is used in the `formDefaultMock` function to set the variant of the form.

### Interaction Summary:
This file primarily interacts with the form component by providing default mock props and variants. It does not directly manage the root styles of the form, so the actual styling may be implemented in a separate file or component.

### Developer Questions:
1. Where are the root styles for the form component defined?
2. How are the default mock props from this file used in the form component?
3. Are there other variants for the form component, and where are their styles defined?
