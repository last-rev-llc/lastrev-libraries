### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles and props for the Accordion component in a Material UI application. It includes the definition of AccordionProps, AccordionOwnerState, AccordionClasses, AccordionClassKey, and also extends the default MUI styles for the Accordion component.

### Import statements:
The file imports type definitions for ComponentsOverrides, ComponentsVariants, ComponentsProps from '@mui/material' and CollectionExpandable_BaseFragmentFragment from '@graphql-sdk/types'.

### Default Props List:
The default props for the Accordion component are defined in the AccordionProps interface, which extends the CollectionExpandable_BaseFragmentFragment type and adds a variant property of type AccordionVariants.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the Accordion component are defined in the AccordionClasses interface, which includes the following keys: root, contentOuterGrid, introTextGrid, introText, accordionItem, summaryWrap, summary, detailsWrap, and details. These styles likely define the layout and appearance of the Accordion component and its child elements.

### Variants:
The AccordionVariants enum defines a single variant called 'default'. The file also extends the MUI styles to include the variants for the Accordion component, allowing for custom styling based on the variant.

### Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the styles and props for the Accordion component. Other components or pages that use the Accordion component will inherit these styles and props, allowing for consistent styling and behavior across the application.

### Developer Questions:
1. How can I customize the styles for different variants of the Accordion component?
2. What are the default props for the Accordion component and how can I override them?
3. How do the root styles defined in this file affect the appearance of the Accordion component in different contexts?
4. Are there any specific interactions or dependencies with other components that I need to be aware of when working with the Accordion component?
