### Summary:
This theme file contains functions to generate mock data for an Accordion component. It includes default props for the Accordion, as well as specific mock data for different variants of the Accordion component.

### Import statements:
- `introTextMock` from '../Text/Text.mock': Mock data for the introductory text of the Accordion.
- `collectionExpandableItemBaseMock`, `collectionExpandableItemQuotesMock`, `collectionExpandableItemBlocksMock` from '../CollectionExpandableItem/CollectionExpandableItem.mock': Mock data for expandable items within the Accordion.
- `randomId` from '../utils/randomId': Utility function to generate a random ID.
- `AccordionProps, AccordionVariants` from './Accordion.types': Type definitions for Accordion props and variants.

### Default Props List:
- `accordionBaseMock(override?: Partial<AccordionProps>): AccordionProps`: Function to generate default props for the Accordion component.
- `accordionBlocksMock({ ...override } = {})`: Function to generate mock data for an Accordion with blocks variant.

- `accordionCollectionsMock({ ...override } = {})`: Function to generate mock data for an Accordion with collections variant.
- `default accordionBaseMock`: Default export, generates default props for the Accordion component.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the Accordion component are not explicitly defined in this file. The styles for the Accordion component are likely defined in a separate file or component.

### Variants:
- `AccordionVariants.default`: Default variant for the Accordion component.

### Interaction Summary:
This file provides mock data and default props for the Accordion component. It can be used to generate sample data for testing and development of the Accordion component within the larger application.

### Developer Questions:
1. Where are the actual styles for the Accordion component defined?
2. How can I customize the mock data generated by these functions to suit specific testing scenarios?
3. Are there any additional variants of the Accordion component that need to be accounted for in the mock data?
