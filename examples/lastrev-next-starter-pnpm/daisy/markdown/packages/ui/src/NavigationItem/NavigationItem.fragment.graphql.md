Developer Questions:
1. How can I use these fragments in my GraphQL queries to retrieve navigation-related data?
2. What are the possible variations of the NavigationItem type and how are they represented in the fragments?
3. How can I extend or modify these fragments to include additional fields or custom logic for navigation items?
4. What are the potential use cases for the sidekickLookup field in the NavigationItem type?
5. How can I debug issues related to the retrieval of sub-navigation data using these fragments?
