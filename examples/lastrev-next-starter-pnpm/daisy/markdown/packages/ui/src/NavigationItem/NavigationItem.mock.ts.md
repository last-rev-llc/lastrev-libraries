### Summary:
The provided theme file contains mock data and functions for creating different types of navigation items. It includes default props for a navigation item, as well as variations for text, base, and nested navigation items.

### Import statements:
The file imports the `randomId` function from the `randomId` module and the `NavigationItemProps` and `NavigationLinkVariants` types from the `NavigationItem.types` module.

### Default Props List:
1. `navigationItemDefaultMock`: Returns default props for a navigation item, including an auto-generated ID, link variant, default href, and text.
2. `navigationItemTextMock`: Returns default props for a text navigation item, with the ability to override any properties.
3. `navigationItemBaseMock`: Returns default props for a base navigation item, with the ability to override any properties.
4. `navigationItemWithChildrenMock`: Returns default props for a navigation item with children, such as a group of sub-navigation items, with the ability to override any properties.
5. `navigationItemWithChildrenNestedMock`: Returns default props for a navigation item with nested children, allowing for multiple levels of sub-navigation items, with the ability to override any properties.

### Root Styles:
The file does not contain any explicit root styles. It primarily focuses on generating mock data for navigation items based on different variants and configurations.

### Variants:
1. `NavigationLinkVariants.link`: Represents a basic navigation link with a text label and a default href.
2. `NavigationLinkVariants.group`: Represents a group of navigation items, which can contain sub-navigation items.

### Interaction Summary:
This file provides mock data and functions for generating different types of navigation items, which can be used for testing and development purposes. It does not directly interact with other parts of the application, but it can be utilized by components that require navigation item data.

### Developer Questions:
1. How can I customize the mock data for navigation items to fit specific use cases?
2. Are there any additional variants or configurations that should be considered for navigation items?
3. How can I integrate the mock data from this file into the actual components that use navigation items?
4. What are the best practices for using the mock data in this file for testing and development purposes?
