- Are there any specific edge cases or error scenarios that need to be tested for the `<NavigationItem />` component?
- What are the expected behaviors of the `<NavigationItem />` component when integrated with other parts of the application?

### Known Issues and Todo Items:
- The test suite currently includes a placeholder test (`test.todo('write tests')`) that needs to be implemented with actual test cases for the `<NavigationItem />` component.
- The file does not include any actual test cases for the `<NavigationItem />` component, so the test coverage needs to be improved.
