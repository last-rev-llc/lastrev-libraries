Summary:
The theme file is responsible for managing the styles for the Footer component in a Material UI application. It includes the default props, root styles, and variants for the Footer component.

Import statements:
The file likely includes imports for the FooterProps and FooterClassKey types from './Footer.types', as well as the default export from './Footer'.

Default Props List:
The default props for the Footer component are likely exported from the './Footer' file. These props define the initial state and behavior of the Footer component.

Root Styles:
The root styles in the file define the base styles for the Footer component. These styles may include properties such as color, typography, padding, and margin, which are applied to the root element of the Footer component.

Variants:
The file may define different variants for the Footer component, each with its own set of styles. Variants could include different visual styles for the Footer component, such as different background colors, border styles, or text styles.

Interaction Summary:
The theme file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a centralized location for managing the styles of the Footer component. Other parts of the application that use the Footer component will import the styles from this file to ensure consistency in the visual appearance of the Footer across the application.
