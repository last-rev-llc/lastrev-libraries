### Summary:
This theme file contains a function `cardBaseMock` that generates mock data for a card component. It includes default props for the card, as well as variant overrides for different types of cards such as pricing, media, and icon cards.

### Import statements:
- `richTextCardMock` and `mediaBaseImageMock` are imported from their respective mock files.
- `linkButtonMock` and `linkBaseMock` are imported from the Link mock file.
- `randomId` is imported from the utils folder.
- `CardProps` and `CardVariants` are imported from the Card types file.
- `LinkVariants` is imported from the Link types file.

### Default Props List:
- `id`: A randomly generated ID for the card.
- `__typename`: The type of the card.
- `variant`: The variant of the card, with a default value of `CardVariants.default`.
- `media`: An array containing a single media item, initialized using `mediaBaseImageMock`.
- `overline`: A string representing the overline text of the card.
- `title`: A string representing the title of the card.
- `subtitle`: A string representing the subtitle of the card.
- `body`: A rich text content for the card, initialized using `richTextCardMock`.
- `actions`: An array of link buttons, initialized using `linkButtonMock`.
- `link`: A link object, initialized using `linkBaseMock`.
- `sidekickLookup`: An empty object.
- `loading`: A boolean indicating whether the card is in a loading state, with a default value of `false`.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the card component are managed within the `cardBaseMock` function. These styles include the default content and layout for the card, as well as the variant-specific overrides.

### Variants:
The `cardBaseMock` function supports the following variants:
1. `CardVariants.default`: The default card variant with standard content and layout.
2. `CardVariants.pricing`: A pricing card variant with specific overline, title, and subtitle.
3. `CardVariants.media`: A media card variant with specific content and layout overrides.
4. `CardVariants.icon`: An icon card variant with specific content and layout overrides.

### Interaction Summary:
The `cardBaseMock` function provides a way to generate mock data for different types of card components within the application. It can be used to populate card components with realistic data during development and testing.

### Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional variants to the `cardBaseMock` function?
2. What are the available options for the `variant` prop in the `CardProps` type?
3. How does the `randomId` function generate unique IDs for the cards?
4. What are the expected properties for the `mediaBaseImageMock` and `richTextCardMock` functions?
5. How can I customize the default styles for the card component within the `cardBaseMock` function?
