Summary:
The theme file manages the styles for the Hero component, including default props, root styles, and variants.

- The default export is the `Hero` component itself.

Default Props List:

Root Styles:
The root styles define the base styles for the Hero component, including the layout, typography, and color scheme. These styles may include properties such as padding, margin, background color, and font size.

The file may define different variants for the Hero component, such as "primary" and "secondary." Each variant would have its own set of styles, including background color, text color, and any additional visual modifications.
