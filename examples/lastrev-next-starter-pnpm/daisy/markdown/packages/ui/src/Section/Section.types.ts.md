### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles and props for the Section component in a Material UI application. It includes enum definitions for content directions and section variants, interfaces for props and owner state, and declarations for classes and component overrides.

### Import statements:
The file imports type definitions for component overrides, variants, and props from '@mui/material', as well as a specific type definition for the Section_BaseFragmentFragment from '@graphql-sdk/types'.

### Default Props List:
The default props for the Section component are defined in the SectionProps interface, which includes all properties from the Section_BaseFragmentFragment type except for 'variant' and 'contentDirection'. It also includes the 'variant' and 'contentDirection' properties, which are of type SectionVariants and SectionContentDirections respectively.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the Section component are defined in the SectionClasses interface, which includes the following classes:
- root
- contentOuterGrid
- contentWrap
- contentInnerGrid
- backgroundMediaWrap
- backgroundMedia
- introTextGrid
- introText
- itemsGrid
- sectionItem

### Variants:
The file defines the following section variants:
- default
- onePerRow
- twoPerRow
- threePerRow

Each variant can have its own style overrides defined in the Components interface, allowing for different visual representations of the Section component based on the variant selected.

### Interaction Summary:
The Section component can interact with other parts of the application by allowing developers to apply different styles and layouts to sections of content based on the defined variants and content directions. It can be used to create visually distinct sections within the application.

### Developer Questions:
- How are the section variants used in the application, and what are the visual differences between them?
- What are the available content directions, and how do they affect the layout of the Section component?
- How can developers extend or customize the styles for the Section component based on the defined variants and classes?
