### Summary:
The provided React file is a functional component called Image, which is responsible for rendering images in the application. It utilizes the NextImage component from the 'next/image' library and also handles the rendering of SVG images. The component is primarily used for displaying images with various configurations and optimizations.

### Import statements:
- React: The core library for building the user interface in the application.
- NextImage: A component from the 'next/image' library used for optimizing and rendering images.
- ErrorBoundary: A custom error boundary component used to catch and handle errors within the component.
- ImageProps: A type definition for the props used by the Image component.

### Component:
The Image component is a functional component that renders images based on the provided props. It supports rendering both regular images and SVG images with various configurations and optimizations.

### Hooks:
- React.forwardRef: Used to forward the ref to the underlying DOM element.

### Event Handlers:
The Image component does not have any specific event handlers.

### Rendered components:
- NextImage: Used to render regular images with various configurations and optimizations.
- ErrorBoundary: Wraps the rendered content to catch and handle any errors that may occur during rendering.

### Interaction Summary:
The Image component is a client-side component that interacts with the NextImage component for rendering images. It can be used in various parts of the application to display images with different configurations and optimizations.

### Developer Questions:
- How does the component handle different image formats and optimizations?
- What are the best practices for using the Image component in different parts of the application?
- How does the ErrorBoundary component handle errors specific to image rendering?

### Known Issues and Todo Items:
- The handling of SVG images and inline SVG content could be further optimized for better accessibility and performance.
- The usage of the ref in the NextImage component needs to be addressed for better integration with the Image component.
- Error handling and error messages within the ErrorBoundary component may need further refinement for better user experience.
