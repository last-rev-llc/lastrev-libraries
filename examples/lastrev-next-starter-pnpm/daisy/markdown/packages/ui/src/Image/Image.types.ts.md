### Summary:
This theme file defines the styles and props for the Image component within the Material UI framework. It includes type definitions for the ImageProps and ImageClasses, as well as overrides and variants for the Image component.

### Import statements:
- `ComponentsOverrides`, `ComponentsVariants`, and `ComponentsProps` are imported from `@mui/material` to define the overrides, variants, and props for the Material UI components.
- `ImageProps` is imported from `next/image` to extend the props for the Next.js Image component.

### Default Props List:
- `ImageProps`: Defines the props for the Image component, including src, className, columns, priority, itemProp, testId, media, width, height, disableInlineSVG, nextImageOptimization, sizes, q, unoptimized, and svgContent.

### Root Styles:
The root styles for the Image component are defined using the `styleOverrides` property within the `Components` interface. These styles can be customized and overridden for the Image component.

### Variants:
The file defines variants for the Image component using the `variants` property within the `Components` interface. These variants allow for different styles to be applied to the Image component based on different states or conditions.

### Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a centralized location for managing the styles and props for the Image component. Other parts of the application can import and use these styles and props to ensure consistency and reusability.

### Developer Questions:
1. How can I customize the styles for the Image component using the defined overrides and variants?
2. What are the available props for the Image component, and how can I extend or override them?
3. How do I ensure that the Image component is optimized for performance, considering the nextImageOptimization and unoptimized props?
4. How can I use the defined variants to apply different styles to the Image component based on different conditions or states?
