Summary:
This theme file defines the props and styles for the ContentModule component. It includes the ContentModuleProps interface, ContentModuleClasses interface, and ContentModuleClassKey type. It also exports the default styles for the ContentModule component.

Import statements:
The file imports the Theme interface from '@mui/material/styles'.

Default Props List:
- ContentModuleProps: Defines the props for the ContentModule component, including theme, variant, animation, colorScheme, and other custom props.

Root Styles:
The root styles for the ContentModule component are defined in the ContentModuleClasses interface. However, the actual styles are commented out in the code, so the specific root styles are not explicitly defined in this file.

Variants:
The file does not explicitly define variants and their styles. It only includes the props for variant, which can be used to apply different styles to the ContentModule component based on the variant prop value. The actual styles for each variant would need to be defined elsewhere in the application.

Interaction Summary:
This file primarily serves as a definition for the props and default styles of the ContentModule component. It interacts with other parts of the application by providing the necessary props and default styles for the ContentModule component, which can be used in the component implementation.

Developer Questions:
1. Where are the actual root styles for the ContentModule component defined?
2. How are the theme and colorScheme props used in the ContentModule component?
3. Where can I find the styles for different variants of the ContentModule component?
