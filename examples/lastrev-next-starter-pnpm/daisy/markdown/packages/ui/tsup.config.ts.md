Summary:
This theme file is used to define the configuration for the styles of a component within a larger application. It utilizes the `defineConfig` function from the `tsup` library to set up the configuration options for the component's styles.

Import statements:
The code does not contain any import statements, as it is a simple configuration file and does not require any external dependencies.

Default Props List:
The code does not contain any default props as it is focused on defining the configuration for the component's styles rather than the component's behavior or data.

Root Styles:
The root styles are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. However, the configuration options provided by `tsup` may include settings for the root styles of the component, such as global styles or default theme settings.

Variants:
The code does not explicitly define any variants or their styles. However, the configuration options provided by `tsup` may include settings for different variants of the component, such as different color schemes, sizes, or states.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a centralized configuration for the styles of a specific component. Other parts of the application, such as the component itself or other theme files, may reference this configuration to ensure consistency in the component's styles.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the configuration options in this file applied to the actual component styles?
2. Are there any specific naming conventions or guidelines for defining variants and their styles within this configuration?
3. How does this configuration file integrate with the overall theming strategy of the application?
4. Are there any specific considerations for handling responsive design or dynamic styling within this configuration?
