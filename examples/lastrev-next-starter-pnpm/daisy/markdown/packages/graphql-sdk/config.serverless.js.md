Summary:
The provided code is a Node.js module that exports a configuration object based on the values of environment variables and a configuration file. It is used to configure the content and cache strategies for a GraphQL runner within a broader software application.

Import statements:
- The code imports the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- It also imports a local module `lrConfig` from the `./config` file.

Script Summary:
The script exports a configuration object that determines the content strategy and cache strategy for a GraphQL runner based on the value of the `GRAPHQL_RUNNER_STRATEGY` environment variable. If the value is 'fs', the content strategy is set to 'fs', otherwise, it defaults to 'cms'. The cache strategy is always set to 'redis'.

Internal Functions:
- No internal functions are present in the provided code.

External Functions:
- The script does not contain any external functions.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the broader application by providing a configuration object that determines the content and cache strategies for a GraphQL runner. Other parts of the application can import this configuration and use it to set up the GraphQL runner accordingly.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the environment variables loaded from the `.env` file, and what is the expected format of the `.env` file?
2. What are the possible values for the `GRAPHQL_RUNNER_STRATEGY` environment variable, and how do they affect the content strategy?
3. How is the configuration object used by the GraphQL runner in the broader application?
4. Are there any other configuration options that can be set in the `lrConfig` module?

Known Issues/Bugs:
- No known issues or bugs are identified in the provided code.

Todo Items:
- Consider adding error handling for cases where the `GRAPHQL_RUNNER_STRATEGY` environment variable is not set.

Overall, the code serves as a simple configuration module that determines the content and cache strategies for a GraphQL runner based on environment variables and a configuration file. It is well-structured and does not contain any apparent issues.
