Interaction Summary:
This file serves as the GraphQL schema for the content management system. It defines the structure of various content types and provides queries for fetching content based on different parameters such as display type, ID, locale, and preview mode. The schema also includes custom scalar types and interfaces for defining common fields across different content types.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add a new custom field to an existing content type?
2. What are the available locales for fetching content?
3. How can I fetch content based on specific filters using the `contents` query?
4. What are the different types of content that can be queried using the `content` query?
5. How can I debug issues related to fetching content with specific parameters?
