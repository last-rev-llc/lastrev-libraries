Summary:
The provided code snippet is exporting all the contents from the 'generated/sdk' file. This likely includes type definitions, mappers, and possibly other utility functions related to the GraphQL schema and operations.

Import statements:
The import statement is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed that the 'generated/sdk' file contains imports from other files or libraries that are necessary for the GraphQL functionality.

typeDef List:
The typeDef list will include all the type definitions being exported from the 'generated/sdk' file. These type definitions define the structure of the GraphQL schema, including object types, input types, enums, interfaces, and scalars.

Mappers:
Mappers are used to transform data between the GraphQL schema and the underlying data model. The 'generated/sdk' file likely exports mappers that handle the mapping of GraphQL types to the corresponding data model types. Each mapper will be listed along with its purpose and the content model it is used for.

External Functions:
The 'generated/sdk' file may also export external functions that can be used by other parts of the application. These functions could include query execution functions, mutation functions, or other utility functions related to GraphQL operations. Each function will be listed with descriptions, parameters, and return types.

Interaction Summary:
The 'generated/sdk' file is likely a crucial part of the larger application, as it contains the generated GraphQL SDK with type definitions, mappers, and utility functions. Other parts of the application, such as resolvers, data sources, and client-side code, will interact with the exported contents of this file to perform GraphQL operations.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the type definitions structured and how do they relate to the overall GraphQL schema?
2. What are the specific mappers being used and how are they configured?
3. What are the available external functions for executing GraphQL queries and mutations?
4. How can the utility functions be used and what are the common use cases for them?
5. How can debugging be performed when encountering issues related to the exported contents of the 'generated/sdk' file?
