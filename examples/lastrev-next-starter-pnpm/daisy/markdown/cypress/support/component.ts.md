Summary:
The support/component.ts file is a support file that is automatically processed and loaded before test files in a Cypress testing environment. It serves as a location for global configuration and behavior modifications for Cypress.

Import statements:
- The file imports the commands.js file using ES2015 syntax.
- It also imports the mount function from 'cypress/react'.

Script Summary:
The script serves as a support file for Cypress testing, allowing for global configuration and behavior modifications. It also augments the Cypress namespace to include type definitions for custom commands.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- Cypress.Commands.add('mount', mount): This function adds a custom command 'mount' to Cypress, which is defined as the imported 'mount' function from 'cypress/react'.

Interaction Summary:
The support/component.ts file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a global configuration and behavior modifications for Cypress testing. It also extends the Cypress namespace to include custom commands.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional custom commands to Cypress in this support file?
2. What other global configurations can be modified within this support file?
3. How does the 'mount' function interact with the rest of the testing environment?
4. Are there any limitations or considerations when modifying global behavior in this support file?

Known Issues/Bugs:
- No internal functions or detailed logic provided in the support/component.ts file.
- No specific error handling or potential bugs identified within the file.

Todo Items:
- Consider adding more detailed global configurations or behavior modifications to enhance the testing environment.
- Document best practices and limitations for modifying global behavior within the support file.

Overall, the support/component.ts file serves as a support file for Cypress testing, providing a location for global configuration and behavior modifications. It extends the Cypress namespace to include custom commands and interacts with the rest of the application by enhancing the testing environment. However, it lacks detailed internal logic and error handling, which could be improved for better maintainability and extensibility.
