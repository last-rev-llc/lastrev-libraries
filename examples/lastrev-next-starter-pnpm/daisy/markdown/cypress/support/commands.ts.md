The commands.ts file interacts with the rest of the application by providing custom commands that can be used in Cypress tests to simulate user interactions such as login, drag and drop, and dismissal of elements.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I use the custom login command in my Cypress tests?
2. What are the available options for the drag and dismiss commands?
3. Can I create additional custom commands based on the existing structure?
4. How do I handle errors or exceptions when using these custom commands?
5. Are there any best practices for extending Cypress commands in this manner?
