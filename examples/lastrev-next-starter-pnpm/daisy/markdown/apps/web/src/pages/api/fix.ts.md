```
API Summary:
This file contains a single API endpoint that handles requests and sends back a JSON response. The endpoint is responsible for handling CORS and returning a status response along with a timestamp.

Import statements:
The code imports the Next.js NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse types, as well as the cors middleware from a local file.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main function that handles the API request and response. It first runs the cors middleware to handle CORS, then sets the response headers for content type and accept, and finally sends back a JSON response with a status and timestamp.

External Services:
There is a commented-out import statement for a function called fixServices, which is likely an external service for checking and fixing the status of services. However, it is currently not being used in the code.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/route
Summary: This endpoint handles incoming requests and sends back a JSON response with a status and timestamp.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "data": "example data"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "status": "not-implemented",
  "timestamp": 1634235678000
}
```

Interaction Summary:
The API endpoint expects a POST request with a JSON payload. It runs the CORS middleware, sets the response headers, and sends back a JSON response with a status and timestamp.

Developer Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the fixServices function and why is it commented out?
2. Are there any plans to implement the fixServices functionality in the future?
3. Is there a specific reason for returning a hardcoded "not-implemented" status in the response?
4. Are there any additional error handling or validation steps that should be included in the handler function?

TODO:
- Consider integrating the fixServices functionality and utilizing the statusAfterFix variable in the response.
- Add error handling and input validation to the handler function.

Known Issues:
- The fixServices functionality is currently commented out and not utilized in the code.
