### Summary:
The provided file is a server-side component responsible for generating sitemap XML content based on the requested parameters. It uses the `GetServerSideProps` function from Next.js to handle server-side rendering and responds to requests for sitemap XML files. The component interacts with the `@graphql-sdk/client` to fetch sitemap data and dynamically generates the XML content based on the retrieved data.

### Import statements:
- `GetServerSideProps` from 'next': Importing the `GetServerSideProps` function from Next.js to handle server-side rendering.
