API Summary:
This file contains a single API endpoint that handles incoming webhooks and processes them using the handleWebhook function. It also includes CORS handling for cross-origin requests.

Import statements:
- NextApiHandler, NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: These are types imported from the 'next' package and are used to define the handler function signature.
- handleWebhook: This is a function imported from the '@last-rev/contentful-webhook-handler' package, used to process incoming webhooks.
- cors: This is a function imported from the '../../cors' file, used for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests.
- lrConfig: This is a configuration object imported from 'graphql-sdk/config.serverless', used as a parameter for the handleWebhook function.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main Next.js API handler function that processes incoming requests. It uses the handleWebhook function to process the webhook payload and sends a success or error response accordingly.

External Services:
- handleWebhook: This function interacts with an external service to process the incoming webhook payload.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/webhook
Summary: This endpoint handles incoming webhooks and processes them using the handleWebhook function.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/webhook \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "data": "webhook payload"
  }'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "Success"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
- When a POST request is made to /api/webhook with a JSON payload, the handler function processes the webhook using the handleWebhook function and sends a success response if successful.

Developer Questions:
- How is the lrConfig object configured and what parameters does it require?
- What are the potential error scenarios that can be encountered when processing webhooks?
- How is the CORS handling implemented and configured in the application?

TODO:
- Add detailed error handling and logging for webhook processing.
- Document the expected structure of the webhook payload for better understanding.

Known Issues:
- None at the moment.
