API Summary:
This file contains a single API endpoint for retrieving the theme data from the UI theme registry. The endpoint is accessed via an HTTP GET request and returns the theme data in JSON format.

Import statements:
The code imports the Next.js types for API request and response handling, as well as the 'cors' function from a local 'cors' module.

Internal Functions:
- themeHandler: This is the main function that handles the API request. It takes the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse<Data> as parameters and uses the 'cors' function to handle CORS. It then imports the theme data from the UI theme registry and sends it back as the API response.

External Services:
The code interacts with the UI theme registry to import the theme data.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/theme
Summary: This endpoint retrieves the theme data from the UI theme registry.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/theme
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "name": "light"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. When a GET request is made to /api/theme, the themeHandler function is called.
2. The themeHandler function uses the 'cors' function to handle CORS and then imports the theme data from the UI theme registry.
3. The theme data is sent back as the API response.

Developer Questions:
- How is the theme data structured in the UI theme registry?
- Are there any specific headers required when making a request to this endpoint?

TODO:
- Add error handling for cases where the theme data cannot be retrieved.
- Consider adding caching for the theme data to improve performance.

Known Issues:
- None at the moment.
