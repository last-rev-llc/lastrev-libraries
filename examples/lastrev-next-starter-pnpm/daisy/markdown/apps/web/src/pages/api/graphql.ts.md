API Summary:
This file contains a Next.js API route handler that utilizes the createVercelHandler function from the '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core' package to create an API endpoint for handling GraphQL requests. The endpoint is configured to disable the Apollo Server landing page and introspection.

Import statements:
- NextApiHandler, NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: These are types imported from the 'next' package for defining the API handler and request/response objects.
- createVercelHandler: This function is imported from the '@last-rev/graphql-contentful-core' package and is used to create a Vercel-compatible API handler for GraphQL requests.
- ApolloServerPluginLandingPageDisabled: This is a plugin imported from the '@apollo/server/plugin/disabled' package and is used to disable the landing page for the Apollo Server.
- lrConfig: This is an imported configuration object from 'graphql-sdk/config.serverless' used to configure the GraphQL server.
- cors: This is a function imported from the 'cors' file located in the parent directory and is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API endpoint.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main API handler function that is exported as the default handler for the API route. It is an asynchronous function that takes the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse as parameters. Inside the function, it first awaits the CORS handling using the cors function, and then it returns the result of calling the createVercelHandler function with the configured lrConfig to handle the GraphQL requests.

External Services:
The API endpoint interacts with the following external services:
- GraphQL server: The createVercelHandler function is used to create an API handler for GraphQL requests, which interacts with a GraphQL server to process and respond to the requests.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/route
Summary: This endpoint handles incoming GraphQL requests and forwards them to the GraphQL server for processing.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "{ hello }"
  }'
```
Example Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "world"
  }
}
```

Interaction Summary:
- The API endpoint receives incoming GraphQL requests and passes them to the GraphQL server for processing. The server responds with the result of the GraphQL query, which is then returned to the client.

Developer Questions:
- How is the lrConfig object configured and where is it defined?
- What other plugins or configurations can be added to the ApolloServerOptions?
- How is error handling and logging managed within the createVercelHandler function?
- Are there any specific security considerations for handling GraphQL requests in this context?
