API Summary:
This file contains a Next.js API route handler that is responsible for syncing data with Algolia. It uses the createAlgoliaSyncHandler function from the '@last-rev/graphql-algolia-integration' package to handle the synchronization process. The endpoint expects a POST request with a JSON body containing the data to be synced.

Import statements:
- NextApiHandler, NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: These are imported from the 'next' package and are used to define the API handler function and handle the request and response objects.
- cors: This is imported from a local 'cors' module and is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API endpoint.
- createAlgoliaSyncHandler: This is imported from the '@last-rev/graphql-algolia-integration' package and is used to create the handler for syncing data with Algolia.
- lrConfig: This is imported from 'graphql-sdk/config.serverless' and contains the configuration for the Last Rev GraphQL SDK.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main API handler function that processes the incoming request, calls the createAlgoliaSyncHandler function to sync the data with Algolia, and sends the appropriate response back to the client. It uses the cors function to handle CORS and constructs the URL for the GraphQL endpoint based on the environment.

External Services:
- Algolia: The API endpoint interacts with Algolia to sync data with the search index.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/sync
Summary: This endpoint is used to sync data with Algolia. It expects a JSON body containing the data to be synced.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/sync \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "data": "data to be synced"
  }'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "Success"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The client sends a POST request to /api/sync with the data to be synced in the request body.
2. The handler function processes the request, handles CORS, constructs the GraphQL endpoint URL, and calls the createAlgoliaSyncHandler function to sync the data with Algolia.
3. If the synchronization is successful, the handler sends a 200 OK response with the message "Success". If there is an error, it sends a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.

Developer Questions:
- How is the maxRecords value used in the synchronization process?
- What are the potential error scenarios that can occur during the synchronization process?
- How can we handle authentication and authorization for this API endpoint?

TODO:
- Add detailed error handling and logging for better error reporting.
- Consider adding authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API endpoint.

Known Issues:
- None identified at the moment.
