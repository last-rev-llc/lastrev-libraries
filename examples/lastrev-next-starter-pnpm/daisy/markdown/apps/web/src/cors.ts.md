Summary:
The provided code is a TypeScript module that defines a middleware function for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in a Next.js API route. It exports a function to initialize middleware and a pre-configured CORS middleware for use in Next.js API routes.

Import statements:
- `Cors`: This import is used to bring in the CORS middleware for handling cross-origin requests.
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse`: These imports are from the Next.js framework and are used to define the types for the request and response objects in Next.js API routes.

Script Summary:
The script provides a utility function `initMiddleware` that takes a middleware function as input and returns a new function that can be used as middleware in Next.js API routes. It also exports a pre-configured CORS middleware `cors` for use in Next.js API routes.

Internal Functions:
1. `initMiddleware(middleware: any)`: This function takes a middleware function as input and returns a new function that wraps the provided middleware. It takes the request and response objects as input and returns a promise. It handles the execution of the provided middleware and resolves or rejects the promise based on the result.

External Functions:
1. `cors`: This is a pre-configured CORS middleware created using the `initMiddleware` function. It allows only GET, POST, and OPTIONS requests.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the broader application by providing a reusable middleware function for handling CORS in Next.js API routes. It can be used to ensure that cross-origin requests are handled appropriately within the application.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use the `initMiddleware` function to create custom middleware for my Next.js API routes?
2. What are the available configuration options for the pre-configured `cors` middleware?
3. How does the `initMiddleware` function handle errors and what is the recommended approach for error handling in custom middleware?
4. Can I extend the functionality of the `cors` middleware to support additional HTTP methods or headers?

Known Issues/Bugs:
No known issues or bugs.

Todo Items:
- Consider adding support for additional HTTP methods or headers in the pre-configured `cors` middleware.
- Document the usage and configuration options of the `initMiddleware` function for developers.
