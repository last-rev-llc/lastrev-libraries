Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional environment variables to the configuration?
2. What are the potential implications of setting `ignoreBuildErrors` to `true` in the TypeScript configuration?
3. How can I modify the webpack configuration further to include additional aliases or loaders?
4. What is the purpose of the `modularizeImports` configuration for `@mui/icons-material`?
5. How can I extend the functionality of the `redirects` and `rewrites` functions to handle more complex logic or error handling?
