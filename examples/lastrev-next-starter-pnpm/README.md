# LastRev starter

This is an official Starter by LastRev with multiple meta-frameworks all working in harmony and sharing packages.

This example also shows how to use [Workspace Configurations](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/configuring-workspaces).

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest -e kitchen-sink
```

## What's inside?

This repo includes the following packages and apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a complete React UI library for displaying content
- `scripts`: Jest and ESLint configurations
- `tsconfig`: tsconfig.json's used throughout the monorepo

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This LastRev has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
