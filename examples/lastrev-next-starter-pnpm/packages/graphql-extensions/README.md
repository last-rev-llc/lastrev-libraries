# GraphQL Extensions

The LastRev Framework allows you to create a GraphQL schema that is based on the content models in Contentful. Most people will be able to use the generated schema without too many modifications. But if you want to add custom fields or resolver behavior, you can do so through extensions.

## Extensions Concepts

### TypeDefs

A TypeDef extension can be used to create new types or extend existing types. The graphql-tag library can be used to declare type definitions.

For example, creating a new type:

```javascript
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

export const typeDefs = gql`
  type SomeNewType {
    name: String
    description: String
    reference: Content
  }
`;
```

Or extending an existing type:

```javascript
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

// adds a new field, settingsGlobal, a reference to a SettingsGlobal type to the PageGeneral type.
export const typeDefs = gql`
  extend type PageGeneral {
    settingsGlobal: SettingsGlobal
  }
`;
```

> Note: Changing the return type of an existing field is not possible. For reference fields, this should not be a problem, since all reference fields are typed as Content. If a change is needed, a workaround would be to create a new field and use a mapper to resolve it.

### Mappers

Mappers are a construct that we use on top of the standard [Apollo GraphQL Resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/) to allow for the resolution and mapping of fields. In most cases, mapping fields and resolving values for fields coming from Contentful can and should be done through mappers. If more complex behavior or other data sources are needed, a custom resolver can be used (see Resolvers below).

### Display Types

Mappers introduce the concept of a display type. This is a useful way to shoehorn one type into another. For Example, many times we want to display something in a Card type, but do not want to go through the trouble of creating a Card content item that has a pointer to a different item in it. Instead, we can simply use mappers to map the existing item into a Card item.

### Field Mappers

Fields can be mapped by either using a simple string, which tells the mapper to resolve the field using the value of the field name referenced in the string or using the standard [resolver function signature](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/#resolver-arguments).

### Apollo Context

The third argument of the resolver function is the context object. This is a special object that is passed to the resolver function. It contains information about the request, and some useful functions to help with the resolution of the field.

### Structure

Mappers are defined in a 3 level object structure, with the type at the top level, the display type at the second level, and the field at the third level.

Example:

```javascript
export const mappers = {
  PageGeneral: {
    PageGeneral: {
      // resolve this virtual field in pageGeneral
      settingsGlobal: async (item: any, _: never, ctx: ApolloContext) => {
        const settingsGlobal = await ctx.loaders.entryLoader.load({ id: process.env.CONTENTFUL_SETTINGS_ID, preview: !!ctx.preview});

        return settingsGlobal
      }
    }
    Card: {
      // these fields are mapped using strings
      title: 'pageTitle' // resolves from pageGeneral.fields.pageTitle
      content: 'body' // resolves from pageGeneral.fields.body
    }
  }
}
```

### Resolvers

Resolvers are useful when you need to create new queries, or whole new types that are not tied to content in Contentful.

Similar to mappers, you would use a resolver function to define the behavior of the field. The same ApolloContext object is passed in.

```javascript
export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    tweets: async (_: never, args: { userId }, ctx: ApolloContext) => {
      const tweets = await axios.get(`https://api.twitter.com/2/users/${userId}/tweets`);

      return tweets;
    }
  },
  Tweet: (tweet: any, _: never, ctx: ApolloContext) => {
    return {
      content: tweet.text,
      // get CMS data for the author, if it exists
      author: await ctx.loaders.entryLoader.load({ id: tweet.authorId, preview: !!ctx.preview })
    };
  }
};
```

### PathConfigs

Lastly, PathsConfigs is how you can define how your webiste paths are generated. The PathsConfigs object is a map of the content type ID to either a pathsConfig Generator function, or a string that will be the root prepended to the slug field of the item.

Path Generator Functions The path generator function gets passed the content item, loaders, default locale, locales, whether it is preview, and the site string (for setups with multiple sites).

It should return an object, keyed by the path, whose value contains the full path, whehter it is the primary path of this content item (can be used for canonical URLs), the contentID of the item, and an array of excluded locales.

The path generator function can generate complex paths with child/parent logic using the loaders to load the parent or child items.

```javascript
const pageGeneral: ContentfulPathsGenerator = async (
  pageItem,
  loaders,
  defaultLocale,
  locales,
  preview = false,
  site
) => {
  if (await validateSite({ item: pageItem, loaders, preview, site, defaultLocale, locales })) {
    const slug = getDefaultFieldValue(pageItem, 'slug', defaultLocale);
    if (!slug) return {};

    const fullPath = slug === 'home' ? '/' : `/${slug}`;

    let parentRef = getDefaultFieldValue(pageItem, 'parent', defaultLocale);

    // Go up the parent tree, prepending parent slug, until no parent is found
    while (parentRef) {
      const parentItem = await loaders.entryLoader.load({ id: parentRef.sys.id, preview });
      if (!parentItem) break;
      const parentSlug = getDefaultFieldValue(parentItem, 'slug', defaultLocale);

      fullPath = `/${parentSlug}${fullPath}`;

      parentRef = getDefaultFieldValue(parentItem, 'parent', defaultLocale);
    }

    return {
      [fullPath]: {
        fullPath,
        isPrimary: true,
        contentId: pageItem.sys.id,
        excludedLocales: []
      }
    };
  }
  return {};
};

export const pathsConfigs = {
  pageGeneral,
  Blog: '/blogs' // this will autmoatically create the path config for each blog with this path: /blogs/{blog.fields.slug['en-US']}
};
```
