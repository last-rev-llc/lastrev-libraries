|---------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **cms-webhook-handler** | 43.96% | 32.72% | 10.52% | 41.58% | **CRITICAL** |

---

## **🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**

### **1. cms-webhook-handler (43.96% coverage)**
**Status: CRITICAL - Production webhook handling with low test coverage**

| File | Coverage | Issue |
|------|----------|-------|
| `dynamodbHandlers.ts` | **13.33%** | DynamoDB operations untested |
| `redisHandlers.ts` | **17.39%** | Redis operations untested |
| `helpers.ts` | **42.55%** | Core helper functions partially tested |

**Risk:** Critical webhook processing logic for production systems lacks adequate test coverage.

### **2. graphql-cms-helpers createContext.ts (53.19% coverage)**
**Status: HIGH - Core GraphQL context creation logic**

- Lines 69-96, 112-127 uncovered
- Apollo Server integration paths untested
- CMS-specific context creation logic gaps

---

## **📋 Recommended Action Plan**

### **Immediate Priority (Next Sprint)**
1. **cms-webhook-handler** - Add comprehensive tests for DynamoDB and Redis handlers
2. **graphql-cms-helpers** - Complete createContext.ts test coverage
3. **sitemap-generator** - Add tests for generator components

### **Medium Priority (Following Sprint)**
4. **logging** - Complete logging functionality coverage
5. **cms-sync-to-fs/utils** - Improve utility function coverage
6. **app-config** - Add edge case and validation testing

### **Low Priority (Future)**
7. **Branch coverage improvements** across well-tested packages
8. **Integration test expansion** for critical paths

---

## **🏆 Success Stories**

### **Major Improvements This Cycle**
- **cms-path-util**: Complete transformation from 16% to 100% coverage
- **cms-sync-to-fs**: Significant improvement with Sanity sync fully tested
- **Overall project**: Improved from 88.17% to **90.39%** statement coverage

### **Consistently High-Performing Packages**
- **contentful-webhook-parser**: Maintains 100% coverage
- **graphql-schema-gen**: Maintains 100% coverage  
- **cms-fs-loader**: Consistently high performance (98.71%)
